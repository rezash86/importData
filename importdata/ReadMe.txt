1- use java 1.8 .
2- with maven we can have the dependencies
3- dbSql shows the script for db (creating db and creating table)
4- Beans.Xml is used for config of db- just use your password after creating the db
5- Run either Application.java which has main method or Run ImportDbServiceTest.java (should be Green :)) )
